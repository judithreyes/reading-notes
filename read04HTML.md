# Chapter 18 Notes - Process & Design

## Know your target audience for your website

It is important to know your target audience so you can design your website
to fit their needs. Some important questions to ask are:

* What is the age range of your audience? Gender?
* Which country is your target audience visiting from?
* How often will they be visiting your website?
* Why are they visiting your website? What is their motivation?
* What are the goals of your visitors? What do they want out of your website?

### What information do your visitors need?

Once you've identified your target audience, you will want to figure out 
what sort of information they'll need from your website. Will you need to
offer more background information on your website? 

### How often will your site be visited?

Some websites may need to be updated more frequently than others, especially
if your website offers a service that is constantly changing. For example,
a news website will change more frequently than others because there is different
news everyday. 

### Site Map

A site map will help you organize the information on your page into sections.
Card sorting is a technique that helps you decide which information should
go that works for your page. A wireframe is a sketch of your information 
that needs to be organized on your site. Visual hierarchy can help make your
website easier to read and navigate. 

# Chapter 1 Notes - Structure

## HTML focuses on the structure of pages

### HTML code is descriptive words contained by brackets, which are called elements.
Elements are made up of two tags, an opening and a closing tag. 
Attributes tell us more information about the contents of an element. 
Attributes are made up of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.
To be successful with HTML, it is helpful to learn different tags and what they do. 

# Chapter 17 Notes - HTML5 Layout

## HTML5 Layout Elements

Elements in the HTML5 layout differ in some ways from < div > elements. For example, the header sits in a 
new < header > element. The < header > and < footer > can be used in different ways. Each < article > and < section > element can have its own < header > and < footer >. These new elements make it so web creators can use them to describe the structure of the page.

### Figures < figure > < figcaption >

The < figure > element should have a < figcaption > element, which provides an explanation of the < figure > element. 
Some examples of when to use < figure >:

* Images
* Videos
* Graphs
* Diagrams 
* Code samples
* Text that supports the main body of an article

### Older Browsers

Older browsers that aren't updated to understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 or earlier versions, JavaScript will be needed. If they don't use JavaScript, then they won't be able
to see these HTML5 elements. 

# Chapter 8 Notes - Extra Markup

## The Evolution of HTML

Over the years, different versions of HTML have been used. These versions include:

* HTML 4-released in 1994
* XHTML 1.0-released in 2000 
* HTML 5-being used now

### Comments in HTML

To create a comment in your code that won't be shown in the browser, add your comment between these characters: <!-- comment goes here -->
Comments are helpful for you or someone else reading your code to understand it better. 

### Grouping Text & Elements Inline

The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It's used to either:

* Contain a part of text when there is no other element that can be used to differentiate it from other text
* Contain a number of inline elements

The <iframes> cut windows into your web page so other pages can be displayed. Escape characters are used to include special characters.
