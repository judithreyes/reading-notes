### Growth Mindset
**What is Growth Mindset?**
+ Growth Mindset means that you may not know everything at first, but you are willing to learn more to develop your abilities. 

How to stay in a growth mindset through 3 examples:
1. Work through challenges and embrace them instead of avoiding them or giving up easily.
2. When you are given criticism or constructive feedback, learn and grow from it instead of ignoring it.
3. When you are faced with an obstacle, stay focused and persist through it.
