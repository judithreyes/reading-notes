# Resources on how to choose a text editor

## What is a text editor?

A text editor is software that you can download and install on your computer. It helps you write and change your text, even text that you use to build a website. 
Choosing a text editor that works for you is important for any web developer. 

### What features should you look for in a text editor?
1. Code completion
2. Syntax highlighting
3. Variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. Selection of extensions

### Code Completion

Code completion allows you to start typing a code, then the feature will display possible suggestions to help you finish your code based on what you typed. 
This saves you time by providing a choice. 

Some code completion includes:
- closing of tags when you open them
- closing brackets when you open them
- closing quotation marks when you open them
