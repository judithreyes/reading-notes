### Differences between text editors and IDE

While a text editor edits and manages text, an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger all in one. It is similar to Microsoft Outlook in the sense that it does many things for you all in one program. An IDE is typically used when you are more experienced.
