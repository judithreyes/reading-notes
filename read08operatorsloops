# Comparison and Logical Operations notes

## Boolean

You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to another, resulting in a boolean. A boolean is either true or false. 

Some examples of operators are:

1. Is equal to == 
2. Is not equal to != 
3. Strict equal to === 
4. Strict not equal to !==
5. Greater than >
6. Less than <
7. Greater than or equal to >=
8. Less than or equal to <=

### Logical operators

Comparison operators will usually return single values of true or false. Logical operators let you compare the results of more than one compariosn operator. 

Some examples of operators are:

1. Logical And &&. This operator tests more than one condition. 
2. Logical Or ||. This operator tests at least one condition.
3. Logical Not !. This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it. 

### Loops

Loops check a condition. If the statement is true, then your code will run. Once the first part of code runs, the condition will be checked again.
It continually checks if the condition is true until it is false. There are three common types of loops:

1. A For Loop-Use a for loop if you need to run code a specific number of times. It is the most common loop.
2. A While Loop-You should use a while loop if you aren't sure how many times the code should run. 
3. A Do While Loop-A do...while loop is similar to the while loop, but it will always run the statements inside the curly braces at least once, even if the condition is false. 

A for loop used a counter as a condition. This tells the code to run a specified number of times. The condition is made up of three statements:

1. Initialization-create a variable and set it to 0. The variable used is usually called i, and it acts as the counter. Example: var i = 0;
2. Condition-The loop should continue to run until the counter reaches a specified number. Example: i < 10;
3. Update-Every time the loop has run the statements in the curly braces, it adds one to the counter. Example: i++
