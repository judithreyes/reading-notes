## Introducing How Computers Work

Information is represented inside a computer using electrical signals going on and off. Computers use circuits to do everything. It's important to learn how computers work in order to do other things like coding.

### What Makes A Computer, A Computer?

Computers are everywhere, in pcokets, cars, wrists, possibly your backpack. Computers have to perform 4 different tasks: Take input, store information, process it, then output the results. Computers started out as calculators that solved problems. When you input info to a computer, it then stores it. Then a computer's processor takes info from memory, manipulates it using an algorithm, then sends the info back to be stored in memory again. Then it will be ready to be output. 

### Binary and Data

Wires and cicruits carry all the information in a computer. The on and off state of a wire is a called a bit. It's the smallest piece of information that a computer can store. The more wires you have, the more 1s and 0s you'll have with information. The binary system only uses a 0 and 1. Any number can be represented by only 1s and 0s. Text, images, and sound can also be represented by numbers. Images are made up of tiny pixels, and each pixel has a color that can be represented with numbers. A typical image has millions of pixels. These store a lot of data. Every sound is a series of vibrations. Vibrations can be represented graphically as a wave form. Every point on the wave form can be represented by a number. More bits in audio means a higher range in number, so 32 bit is better qulaity than 8 bit. 

### Circuits and Logic

Circuitry can be an art form. Every input or output of a computer is a type of information which can be represented by on or off electrical signals, or 1s and 0s. A computer uses millions of electronic components that form circuits. Complicated circuits can take multiple signals, then combine them to give different results. You can make a circuit that adds two bits together called an adder, which then calculates the bits to make a sum. Different electrical circuits can perform subtraction and addition. Smaller computers are faster because the smaller the circuit is, the less distance the electrical signal has to go. 

### CPU, Memory, Input, and Output

Input converts physical input to binary information. Memory stores the information, a CPU is where all calculations are done, then output devices take information and convert it to physical output. 

### Hardware and Software

Hardware consists of circuits, chips, wires, speakers, and plugs. Software is all of the computer programs or code that runs on the machine. Examples of software include apps, games, websites, and maps. The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer. A CPU has smaller parts that handles different tasks. It has circuits to do math and other circuits to send and receive information to and from different parts of the computer. The CPU knows which circuits to use and when to use them. Software tells the CPU what to do. The operating system of a computer is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
