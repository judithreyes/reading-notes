# Programming with JavaScript Reading Notes

## Intro + Scripts Notes pg. 1-24 
JavaScript makes web pages more interactive through:

1. Access content
2. Modify content
3. Program rules
4. React to events 

Script-A series of instructions that a computer follows to achieve a goal.
The steps to writing a script include: define the goal, design the script, and code each step. 

Syntax is how you put those words together to create instructions that computers can follow. Computers solve problems programmatically by following a series of instructions. 

## Expressions + Operators Notes pg. 74-79

An expression evaluates results in a single value. There are two different types of expressions:

1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable.
2. Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value.

Expressions rely on things called operators. Operators let programmers create a single value from one or more values. 

### JavaScript Arithmetic Operators

JavaScript contains mathematical operators that you can use with numbers. 
Examples of these arithmetic operators are:

1. Addition (+): Adds one value to another
2. Subtraction (-): Subtracts one value from another
3. Division (/): Divides two values
4. Multiplication (*): Multiplies two values using an asterisk
5. Decrement (--): Subtracts one from the current number
6. Modulus (%): Divides two values and returns the remainder

String Operator: There's one string operator and it's the + symbol. It's used to join the strings on either side of it.
Concatenation: The process of joining together two or more strings to create one new string. When you place quotes around a number, it's a string, not a numeric data type. You can't perform addition on strings. 

## Functions Notes pg. 88-94

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of the script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function. Calling a function is when you ask it to perform its task. 

Parameters: Pieces of info passed to a function.

Return Value: When you write a function and expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is a return value. 

### Declaring A Function

To create a function, you give it a name, then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside curly braces. This is function declaring. After declaring the function, you can call the code by executing all the statements between its curly braces with one line of code. When you declare a function, you give it parameters. Parameters act like variables. 

Arguments: When you call a function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses after it. The values are called arguments and are provided as values or variables.
