## Description
This page offers information on what GitHub and Markdown are, along with some examples. I hope you can learn something new as I have. 

### What is Markdown? 
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. Markdown is regular text along with special characters that can format the text. 

### With Markdown you can:
- Control the display of the document
- Format words as bold or italic
- Add images
- Create lists by using numbers, bullet points, dashes, etc.

### Examples of Markdown syntax
### Headers
You use a # to create a header and you use ## for the next header below and so on. 

### Emphasis
Text can become *italicized* by placing one * before and after the word. Text can become **bold** by placing two ** before and after the word. 

### Lists
You are able to make lists as well that are ordered or unordered. 

Unordered list example:
* Item 1
* Item 2

Ordered list example:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2

With Markdown, you will also be able to place images, links, task lists, tables, SHA references, strikethrough effects, username @mentions, emojis, and block quotes in your text. This is a short explaination of mastering markdown. I hope you were able to learn new things and are able to use Markdown one day!
